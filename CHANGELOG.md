# Changelog

## [2.1.0] - 2025-11-19

Sync only handles files and creates missing directories during upload.
However, it should also manage directories:

- They should (optionally) be removed if:
  - for example, a directory is empty because all files have been deleted from it.
  - or if a directory no longer exists locally.

This is now taken into account with the option: `cleanupEmptyDirs`.

## [2.0.0] - 2025-11-18

### Breaking

- CLI flags renamed:
  - `--upload-list` → `--sidecar-upload`
  - `--download-list` → `--sidecar-download`
- Configuration per connection restructured:
  - `localRoot` / `remoteRoot` now under `sync`
  - `sidecar` block for sidecar uploads/downloads

### Added

- Separate `sidecar.localRoot` / `sidecar.remoteRoot` für Upload-/Download-Listen.
